-- Question 7
/*
The difference between a left outer join and a right outer join are the tables that
will be displayed. In a left outer join, all of the rows from the left table will be
displayed, even if there are any matching columns in the right table. In a right 
outer join, all of the rows from the right table will be displayed, regardless if 
there are any matching columns in the left table. 
*/

-- Example of Left Outer Join:
select *
from Orders
left outer join Customers
on customers.cid = orders.cid

-- Here orders would be the left table because it comes first in our join statement. This 
-- makes the customers table the right table. The result has all of the orders table and
-- values for parts of the customers table.

-- Example of Right Outer Join:
select *
from Orders
right outer join Customers
on customers.cid = orders.cid

-- Here orders would still be the left table because it comes first in our join statement.
-- Making the customers table the right table. The result has all of the customers table 
-- and values for parts of the orders table.
