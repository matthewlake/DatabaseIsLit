-- 8. Check Constraints
/*
Check constraints are used to limit the value range that can be placed in a column.
A check constraint enforces domain integrity by limiting the values that are accepted
by one or more columns. Check constraints determine the valid values from a logical 
expression. The advantage of check constraints are their ability to enforce rules
in the database and provide data integrity. A check constraint can be used with any 
logical boolean expression that returns true or false. An example of a good use of 
check constraint is on prices for products, simply because no product can have a 
negative value. Another good use would be regarding someones age, if a person was 
allowed to buy alcohol. We know that you must be 21 or older to purchase alcohol, 
so a check constraint would work in this scenario. A bad example of using check 
constraints would be regarding social security numbers. This is because it is not 
necessary to restrict social security number since they are unique or an individual
may not have one which would create a null value and not allow for a check constraint
to work.
